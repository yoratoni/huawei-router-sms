# Huawei SMS forwarding
A Python CLI program that I made a long time ago and recently updated, that allows you to work
with SMS received on a 4G Huawei router.

**Why ?** <br />
As a 4G router takes a SIM card, it has a phone number and can be used to send SMS.
But everytime you want to send one, you need to access your router interface on the internet,
so this app allows you to transfer these received SMS directly to your phone, or to automatically reply to them.

**Credits:** <br />
This program uses the [Huawei LTE API](https://github.com/Salamek/huawei-lte-api) created by [Salamek](https://github.com/Salamek).


Features:
---------
These features are configurable from the `config.yaml` file at the root of the project (`/src`).

- **Contacts**: Allows you to link a name to a phone number, making it easier to identify each forwarded number.
- **Forwarders**: The SMS received by the router are forwarded to these numbers, a whitelist can be added
  to redirect only some numbers.
- **Repliers**: An auto-reply system, if a message is received from a specific number, and this message contains a specified string,
  like, if it starts with an "Hi!" (or "Hi!" at any place inside of the message), it replies something.
  I added this feature for someone who needed it to send an automatic message to his internet provider.


Config:
-------
The configuration is defined inside a YAML file, I decided to use that instead of the original `.env` file because it's a lot more user-friendly, even if putting a password inside of it is not the best practice, as the network is local,
the risk is minimal, I could add an .env file only for the password later if necessary.

If you really don't want to put your password inside the config file, you can create a `config.dev.yaml` next to the original `config.yaml`, it will load this one instead of the original one. I added it to the `.gitignore` for my own config.


Repliers:
---------
Someone contacted me to add this feature, so it'll be the perfect example of what can be done with it:

The Internet provider that this person uses limits the internet speed after a 20GB daily usage, his provider then
sends a message informing him that the connection speed is now limited to 64/64kbps (download/upload), and that
if he wants 20 more GBs, he needs to send "NADALJUJ" ("CONTINUE" in Slovene), a great way to do that could be
to use the replier system:

So now, if the number `+33123456789` sends a message that contains `Obvescamo vas, da ste presegli celotno kolicino`
at any place inside of it, the router will send `NADALJUJ` back.

Of course , multiple repliers can be added, and multiple filters too:

```yaml
repliers:
  - phone_number: "+33123456789"
    messages:
      - filter: "HI"
        reply: "HELLO"
      - filter: "HELLO"
        reply: "HI"
  - phone_number: "+33 9 87 65 43 21" # Supporting spaces
    ...
```


History:
--------
Here's an example of a forwarded SMS inside the history, the history can be found inside `/logs/history.json`.

**Details**: <br />
- "40086" corresponds to the SMS ID (used by the router to identify every SMS).
- "Phone" is the phone number (not impacted by the contact names).
- "Content" is simply the content of the SMS
- "Date" is the date when the SMS has been received, not forwarded.
- "Contact" is the contact name that you optionally added to the "contacts" field inside the YAML file.
